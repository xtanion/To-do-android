To-do-android
=================

It's a simple TODO list android application.

It's based on [Model-View-View-Model(MVVM)](https://medium.com/upday-devs/android-architecture-patterns-part-3-model-view-viewmodel-e7eeee76b73b) Architecture and uses modern android libraries such as [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/getting-started#take_advantage_of_jetpack), [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) and [Co-routines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-guide.html).

* [Architecture][1] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
* [Data Binding][2] - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
* [Lifecycles][3] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
* [LiveData][4] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
* [Navigation][5] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
* [Safe Args][17] - Paasing arguments b/w Fragments.
* [Room Database][6] - Access your app's SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.
* [ViewModel][7] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
     asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
* [WorkManager][8] - Manage your Android background jobs.
* [UI][9] - Details on why and how to use UI Components in your apps - together or separate
  * [Animations & Transitions][10] - Move widgets and transition between screens.
  * [Fragment][11] - A basic unit of composable UI.
